# Micro Invaders Firmware (UDP)

This repository contains firmware for the [robots](https://github.com/robot-uprising-hq/ai-robot-hardware) that can be used in [Micro Invader competition](https://github.com/robot-uprising-hq/ai-guide).

The firmware supports Wifi and Bluetooth. If WiFi is used, the motor commands can be send via simple encoded UDP messages.

The firmware works well with [zero-ones-simulated](https://github.com/zero-ones-given/zero-ones-simulated) simulator.

There is also another alternative firmware for the robot, [ai-robot](https://github.com/robot-uprising-hq/ai-robot), which uses protocol buffers to serialize the data. It works well with [ai-simulator](https://github.com/robot-uprising-hq/ai-simulator).

## Getting started

Prepare yourself for an adventure in robotics! And remember, the real treasure in programming is not the result but the bugs we make along the way.

### Assembly

Connect the right motor to connector J2 and the left motor to J3.

### Configure WiFi or Bluetooth via serial

- Make sure the firmware has been flashed
- Connect board to computer via USB
- Establish [serial connection](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v4.1/get-started/establish-serial-connection.html)

You can connect for example using screen or the monitor command if you have the Espressif toolchain installed:

    screen [port] 115200

To connect to WiFi, press any key to open the terminal and then press the `w` key. The terminal will prompt you for the WiFi ssid and password and then reboot the robot. After rebooting, you can use the `i` command to check the ip that was assigned to the robot during startup.

### Controlling the robot

Once you have set up the Wi-Fi connection, you should be able to control the robot by sending UDP messages to port 3000. The message should be a string consisting of two integers between 100 and -100 separated by a semicolon. You can try it out e.g. with the following command:

    echo -n '50;-50' | nc -u [robot ip] 3000

Or by modifying and running the [python example](examples/send-udp.py)


## Flashing the firmware

Install the Espressif toolchain: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v4.1/

Before using the toolchain you should set the environment by running (in the terminal you want to use to run it):
```
. $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh
```

Build and flash the project:

    idf.py build
    idf.py -p [port] flash


## Troubleshooting

If you have trouble flashing, you can try running menuconfig and ensure that:

- bluetooth classic is enabled and BLE is disabled
- the custom partition table partitions.csv is selected
- at least 4MB flash size is selected from `Serial flasher config > Flash size`

```
    idf.py menuconfig
```

To take a look at the log output or connect to the built in console, you can:

    idf.py -p [port] monitor

To exit the monitor press `ctrl + ]` (`ctrl + 5` On a Finnish keyboard)
